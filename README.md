# Portfolio

Here's a collection of projects I've built as part of the learning process. Many of these are steps taken to projects that I'm currently building--for clients, for friends, for myself, for fun--that aren't ready to go up here. Some come from tutorials; others are things I wanted to try out or problems I wanted to work through on their own before integrating them into another project.

Below is a list of the projects, tools I used to build each, and a brief description.


## Bookmarking Site
A full-stack bookmarking site. Like Reddit, but lacks the ability to comment on linked articles. Build with React-Redux, Webpack, ES6, and JSX on the front-end, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the server-side.

    npm install && nodemon


## MEAN Login App
A boilerplate for a MEANstack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJs, Node) login system I developed while working on [Camover](https://github.com/crashspringfield/camover). For a better example of how I handle RESTful APIs (this was a learning process), checkout [the bookmarking site](https://github.com/crashspringfield/portfolio/tree/master/bookmarking-site) I wrote with MERN (React-Redux instead of AngularJs)

    node server


## Welp
Basically a Yelp ripoff. A front-end web app that uses Google Map's API, React, ES6, and JSX. This was as much testing (with Karma, Mocha, and Chai) and setting up an environment as building the app itself.

    npm install && npm run start


## News Site or Blog
An example front-end news site using React, Webpack, ES6, and JSX

    npm install && npm run dev


## To-Do App
A simple AF To Do app using React-Flux.

    npm install && npm run dev
    
## Github Profile Battle
A simple React app (using ES5/JSX) that takes 2 Github profiles, makes an API requests, compares the returned stats, and ranks on the winner.

    npm install && npm start
